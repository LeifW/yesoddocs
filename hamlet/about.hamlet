    %p Yesod is a full-featured web framework for Haskell with the goal of creating web applications which are
    %ul
        %li type-safe
        %li secure
        %li RESTful
        %li fast
    %p Our philosophy is to leverage the strengths of Haskell's strong type system wherever possible. Through this approach, we are able to create type-safe URLs, protect against XSS vulnerabilities, and avoid SQL injection attacks. In Yesod, the compiler is the first line of defense against bugs and security holes.
    %p Yesod is built on a number of sophisticated techniques to provide fast performance. Enumerators provide constant memory usage and guaranteed resource collection; blaze-builder avoids unnecessary buffer copying. However, as much as possible, these techniques are kept under the hood so that a user can reap their benefits without getting his/her hands dirty. (But you can always pop the hood if you want.)
