    <title>Request Datatype</title>
    <intro>
        <p>In Yesod, the Request datatype contains all of the raw information sent from the client to the server for each request. You can often avoid using it directly: routing is handled for you, so pathinfo can be ignored. And instead of direct access to GET and POST parameters, the recommended approach is the form library.</p>

        <p>However, sometimes you will need the raw information, and Yesod is happy to provide it. This chapter will give more information, such as how to get a client IP address, list request headers, and parse a request body in an arbitrary format. For now, however, I'll just provide a link to the <xref href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/yesod/0.5.4.2/doc/html/Yesod-Request.html">Yesod.Request</xref> documentation.</p>
