In Yesod, the Request datatype contains all of the raw information sent from the client to the server for each request. You can often avoid using it directly: routing is handled for you, so pathinfo can be ignored. And instead of direct access to GET and POST parameters, the recommended approach is the form library.

However, sometimes you will need the raw information, and Yesod is happy to provide it. This chapter will give more information, such as how to get a client IP address, list request headers, and parse a request body in an arbitrary format. For now, however, I'll just provide a link to the [Yesod.Request](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/yesod/0.5.4.2/doc/html/Yesod-Request.html) documentation.
